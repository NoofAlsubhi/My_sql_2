# Satr Platform course projects:

## [SQL 101]([https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql](https://satr.codes/courses/FtkmhtJpQW/view)https://satr.codes/courses/FtkmhtJpQW/view) and  [SQL 102]([https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql](https://satr.codes/courses/APjgdQqVWR/view)https://satr.codes/courses/APjgdQqVWR/view)

In the SQL101 course, I learned about the basics of SQL in dealing with databases and managing their contents such as storing data, displaying it, and editing it

and In the SQL102 course, I learned how to deal with data in tables and perform operations on them using different functions such as Aggregate functions.
