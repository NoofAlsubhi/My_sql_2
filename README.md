# Satr Platform courses(SQL101, SQL102) projects:



In the SQL101 course, I learned about the basics of SQL in dealing with databases and managing their contents such as storing data, displaying it, and editing it

and In the SQL102 course, I learned how to deal with data in tables and perform operations on them using different functions such as Aggregate functions.
